### Hey there, I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹

Computer button presser extraordinaire working on everything from [software-defined radios](https://github.com/fzliu/osdr-q10) to [machine learning frameworks](https://towhee.io). Currently working on [Towhee](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee). Formerly a part of [Orion Innovations](https://orioniot.cn) and computer vision & machine learning team at Yahoo/Flickr. Feel free to connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn:

Welcome to my blog!

### Supporting me

The best way to support me is by giving [Towhee](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee), the open-source project that I'm currently a maintainer of, a star on Github:

I believe [embedding vectors](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings), an artifact of machine learning models which can serve as excellent representations for unstructured data, will one of the core tools used in data science and other AI applications. Generating these embeddings is exactly what Towhee aims to do.
