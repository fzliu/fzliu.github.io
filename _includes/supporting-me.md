__Supporting me__

The best way to support me is by giving [Towhee](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee), the open-source project that I'm currently a maintainer of, a star on Github (upper-right hand side of the Github page):

I believe [embedding vectors](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings), an artifact of machine learning models which can serve as excellent representations for unstructured data, will become a core component of data science and other AI applications. Generating these embeddings is exactly what [Towhee](https://github.com/towhee-io/towhee) aims to do.
